# MD-Visualization-GROMACS
Let's analyze some parameters and RDFs 📈📊

* MD-Visualization script is to analyze all the information that is extracted from the final GROMACS output. Typically, this is a **_.xvg_** file 🗃️.
* You can use any type of **_.xvg_** files, which were made to analyze the energies of the system or even the RDFs (Multiple files can be analyzed at the same time 😉).
* Most importantly, the last two cells will create graphs, where the cell right before the last will be used to plot the different parameter variations, while the final cell will plot the RDFs.
* Again, you can choose which number of parameters (RDFs) to plot 😉!
* The following are some plots generated from the script:
  1. Plot of energy variation of the system:

  2. Plot of different RDFs:
  <img width="8817" height="4782" alt="rdf- SME-C1-DCM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13587f16-28a2-433d-86b4-d99651a75243" />

**#Important** 🙋‍♂️
* Example files are provided to test the script (RDF-SME-C1-DCM.xvg, energies.xvg, md.pdb).
* All you need is the **_.xvg_** files and the **_.pdb_** file of the system.
* You can also remove the initial frames if there are any discrepancies.
